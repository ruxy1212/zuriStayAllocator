## Background
Zuri has recently acquired a highly intensive developer training facility in Lekki. The facility will be used for designing and developing outsourced projects. The facility has the following features:

- A conference room (Capacity is 500 people)
- 6 bedrooms (Capacity is 4 people per room)

Only 24 people will stay at the facility at any one point in time. The 24 people will consist of the following

- _4 Facilitators_
- _20 Developers_

The 20 Developers will also consist of the following: 

- 10 Developers who are proficient in Smart Contract Development
- 5 Developers who are proficient in frontend technologies
- 5 Developers who are proficient with server-side architecture

## Task
Using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`, design a room allocation system which will allow the developers and facilitators to effectively work on projects together thereby allocating a single facilitator and 3 developers to a single bedroom.
The system must clearly show an error when a bedroom is full to capacity, or when 3 developers with the same skillset are being added to the same bedroom.

Each bedroom must have a dialogue where you can add a person's name, their role and their skill proficiency. Facilitators are proficient at all skill sets.

## Bonus
_As an addition_, you may cater for the gender of the participants thereby splitting females from the males. No male can be added to a room where a female has already been added. (This is not a core requirement but it is a nice have and will clearly set your submission apart from other participants).
